 Good morning, Baltimore!

Some notes:

To run the music system, simply press play. All buttons are GREY and will do something if clicked, same with the filterable user menus. 

The search bar does not actually function, but you may enter into it!

Besides that-- the system will do what is written on it! Go wild!
